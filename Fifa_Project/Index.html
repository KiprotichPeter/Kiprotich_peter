            <h1><u>Background</u></h1>
            <p id="paragraph">Most of the people in the USA don't even know what Fifa World cup is. If you have never heard about ot then, The FIFA World Cup is an international 
                soccer competition that is held every four years and contested by the national teams of countries that are members of the Fédération Internationale de Football 
                Association (FIFA). It is the most prestigious and widely followed soccer tournament in the world, and it attracts the attention of billions of people around the globe. 
                The first FIFA World Cup was held in 1930, and it has been held every four years since then with the exception of 1942 and 1946, when it was not held due to World War II. 
                The World Cup is made up of a qualifying phase, which determines which teams will participate in the final tournament, and a final tournament, which is held over the
                course of a month and features 32 national teams that are divided into eight groups. The final tournament culminates in a knockout phase, in which the remaining teams
                compete in a series of single-elimination matches until only one team is left standing as the champion. The current World Cup champion is France, which won the tournament in 2018.
