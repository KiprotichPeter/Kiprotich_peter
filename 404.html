        to Influencers, social media keeps growing as we move into the future. Influencers are people who have to build a reputation for their knowledge and expertise on a special 
        topic. For some time now, I have been so curious about someone can grow from zero to million followers. After some research, I found some open-source information about Instagram 
        influencers. For this research, I had to see if the number of followers, or Average likes or Total likes and the number of posts you post can affect your influencer score.</ul></font></center>
        <center><font size="+2"><p>Four common types of Influencers are:</p></font></center>

          <h1>Findings</h1>
          <p>Pyhton pandas libray was one of the librays i used when  i was analying and clearing the data. Some of the statistical data I was looking for were median, mode,average,
             maximum value, minimum value and correlation. For all the four graphs I found out that they had different Statistics. But the most important findings was that there was no
             significant correlation between influencer score and the variable I change above. I was not able to determine why is that, however I will try to find more about it.
